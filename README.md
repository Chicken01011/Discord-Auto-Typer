# Discord-Auto-Typer <br>
I recommend running this code on replit.com so you dont have to worry about installing python. <br>
I heavily recommend only making it send messages with a long cooldown, for example if you want to farm some discord bot or something. Discord might disable your account but they wont ban you (the first time atleast).
I havent tested it heavily much, so i recommend using an alt to do whatever you plan to do first just to make sure you dont get spanked by discord. If you need help message me on discord: femboyjophiel
